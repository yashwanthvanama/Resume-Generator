\section*{Professional Summary}
Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience in full-stack development. Proven track record of leading teams, delivering scalable solutions, and driving measurable business outcomes such as increasing revenue by \$2.4M and cutting operational delays by thousands of hours.

\section*{Work Experience}

\subsection{Software Development Engineer | Cognizant Technology Solutions | Jul 2020 – Jul 2023 | Aug 2025 – Present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed a high-level design for a fit-gap analysis of processes of two organizations and their revenue process and systems. Created a seamless system and process integration proposal, resulting in Cognizant securing a \$700K implementation project.
    \item Built a dynamic B2B quoting interface with React + TypeScript, reducing quote creation time from 10 mins to 6 mins and enabling 500+ quotes/day processing.
    \item Built an AI-driven product recommendation engine using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and FP-Growth (from mlxtend) to mine association rules from 100K+ past orders, generating real-time upsell/cross-sell suggestions and increasing average order value by \$1,200.
    \item Developed a Node.js + Express backend to manage pricing workflows and approvals, cutting quote-to-order processing from 3 days to 1 day.
    \item Created a GPT-powered live chat support agent using LangChain and OpenAI, integrated with support center via Node.js, resolving 2,000+ monthly queries and cutting resolution times from 8 hrs to 4 hrs.
    \item Optimized database performance by designing and tuning queries in MongoDB and Oracle, reducing average query latency by 35\% and improving system throughput to handle 10K+ transactions per minute across enterprise applications.
    \item Implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker, delivering 20+ releases/year with near-zero rollback incidents.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Projects}

\subsection{AutoCV | Python, Llama 3.1, Ollama, Selenium, LaTeX, LangGraph | May 2025}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and implemented AutoCV, an agentic AI system that autonomously tailors resumes to job descriptions by orchestrating multiple specialized agents.
    \item Developed a Web Scraper Agent and a Parsing and Keyword Extraction Agent that sends job text to a locally hosted Llama 3.1 LLM on Ollama, leveraging LangGraph for reasoning, planning, and memory management.
    \item Reduced manual resume tailoring time from 30 minutes to under 2 minutes, enabling rapid, high-volume job applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MoveMaster | Python, PyTorch, ChessBench dataset, Transformers, FastAPI | Jun 2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Led development of MoveMaster, an AI engine that predicts the optimal next move in a two-player strategy game (chess) by leveraging historical move sequences.
    \item Fine-tuned a pre-trained transformer architecture inspired by the "ChessFormer" model, adapting its expressive position-aware attention mechanism for accurate next-move prediction.
    \item Deployed MoveMaster as a FastAPI service, enabling seamless integration with game interfaces for real-time inference.
    \item Outperformed baseline Minimax rule-based AI by 78\%-win rate over 500 simulated matches.
\end{itemize}

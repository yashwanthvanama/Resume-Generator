\subsection{Salesforce Developer | Cognizant Technology Solutions | Aug 2021 – Jul 2023 | Aug 2025 – Present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automated the full quote-to-cash lifecycle by implementing Salesforce CPQ and Billing to support subscription and usage-based pricing models, cutting down quote creation time from 30 minutes to under 10 minutes per quote and accelerating month-end revenue recognition by 2–3 days.
    \item Streamlined user provisioning and access control by configuring custom profiles, permission sets, and role hierarchies, while deploying Flow-based automations for product approvals and field updates, reducing IT support tickets from 25 per week to fewer than 10.
    \item Developed Apex triggers and batch classes to auto-renew contracts and synchronize invoice records, enabling back-office teams to process over 1,000 monthly transactions without manual intervention and cutting billing discrepancies from 50 to fewer than 10 per month.
    \item Built secure REST API integrations between Revenue Cloud and the company's legacy ERP system for real-time syncing of orders and invoice statuses, reducing monthly reconciliation time from 3 days to under 1.5 days.
